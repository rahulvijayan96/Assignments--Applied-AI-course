# Assignments--Applied-AI-course
This repo contains various assignment task I had performed in association with Applied AI course

As part of the 1 year Machine Learning course, one major type of assignments that the course demanded was implementing various Data science and machine learning concepts from scratch to deepen the understanding about the underlying math behind these concept. These include concepts like Implementation of various Performance metrics, Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm, Back propogation algorithm, TF-IDF concept from NLP. All these concepts were implemented from Scracth.

Other assignments were the ones involving Datasets like applying various ML algorithms like Decision tree, Naive Bayes on Donors Choose dataset, SQL queris on IMDB dataset, Computer vision Image segmentation on Indian Traffic dataset and more..
